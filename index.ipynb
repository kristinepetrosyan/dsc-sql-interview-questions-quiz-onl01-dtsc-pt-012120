    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "NULL, INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, BLOB _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    " A primary key is a unique identifier for a table. That is, there can only be unique values for this column entry. lastName would not be a good choice for a primary key as it's common for people to have the same last names or even firstName + lastName pairings.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look closely, you'll see that the columns that are the primary key for one table can also appear on other tables. This is known as a foreign key aka the primary key from a different (\"foreign\") table. This is the core idea of how data on different tables is associated in a relational database. If you were told a specific customerNumber, and then given a list of order data that included the customerNumber, you could determine which orders were placed by that customer by matching up the primary and foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________________\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "One-to-one: Both tables can have only one record on either side of the relationship. Each primary key value relates to only one (or no) record in the related table. ... Many-to-many: Each record in both tables can relate to any number of records (or no records) in the other table one to many\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables. LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "Some functions, such as SUM, are used to perform calculations on a group of rows, these are called aggregate functions. In most cases these functions operate on a group of values which are defined using the GROUP BY clause. ... These functions can be used on their own on in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause.\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
